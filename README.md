## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am full-stack engineer from France and I own a company named [LBKE](https://www.lbke.fr/). 

## As a teacher

I train people to the emerging discipline of "LLM development" with technologies such as LangChain/LangGraph, Mastra, Vercel AI SDK.

LLMs are smart, but it's even better when you use them smartly. Being an LLM developer is about crafting complex autonomous software solutions based on AI, aka "Agents".

I am also a Next.js expert, you can discover my [NextPatterns online course here](https://nextpatterns.dev).

You can find all my articles on [my technical blog](https://www.ericburel.tech/blog) and [Smashing magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/author/eric-burel/).

I've previously formalized a pattern for statically rendering personalized content, named [Segmented Rendering](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/07/new-pattern-jamstack-segmented-rendering/).
