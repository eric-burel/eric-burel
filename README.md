## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am full-stack engineer from Europe and I own a company named LBKE. 

## As a teacher

I am Next.js expert, you can discover my [Next.js Patterns online course here](https://www.nextjspatterns.com) and my [3 days live training at Human Coders there](https://www.nextjscourse.online/)

[![Next.js Patterns logo](https://nextjspatterns.com/patterns_logo_text_right.svg)](https://www.nextjspatterns.com)

I've written a complete course around Next.js optimizations based on React Server Components and Static Revalidation, ["Blazing Fast Next.js with React Server Components"](https://www.newline.co/courses/blazing-fast-next.js-with-react-server-components)

You can find all my articles on [my technical blog](https://www.ericburel.tech/blog), [Prismic blog](https://prismic.io/blog/authors/eric-burel), [Medium](https://medium.com/@eric.burel) and [Smashing magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/author/eric-burel/).

I've formalized a pattern for statically rendering personalized content (yes, it's possible and it happens all the time!), named [Segmented Rendering](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/07/new-pattern-jamstack-segmented-rendering/).

## My open source work

I am a member of the [Devographics collective](https://www.devographics.com/) that runs the State of JS, CSS and GraphQL surveys (and maybe more soon?).

Find our [open source monorepository here](https://github.com/Devographics/Monorepo).
